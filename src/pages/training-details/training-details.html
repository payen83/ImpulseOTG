<h4>WHAT IS IMPULSE (EMS) TRAINING?</h4>
<p class="justified1">Impulse training is gentle on your joints, builds up your muscles, increases your strength and stamina, reduces body fat and relieves your back and shoulder problems. The healthiest way of training!</p>
<h4>WHY IMPULSE EMS TRAINING?</h4>
<ul>
	<li class="justified">Save time - EMS elicits much more powerful contractions than possible from regular fitness training. That’s why you can only do it for 20 minutes max per session – it’s that intense! All these make EMS much more effective than conventional fitness training.</li>
	<li class="justified">Build Muscles - 90% of all muscles are trained simultaneously and 20 minutes Impulse (EMS) Training is sufficiently effective as up to 4 hours of conventional gym training. Even the deeper and smaller muscles fibers are activated during each contraction, which does not only increase muscular strength but also enhances the intra- and intercellular coordination.</li>
